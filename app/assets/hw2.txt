# Homework 2 - Rails Intro
The assignment was a good introduction to Rails. There is a lot of 'magic' that happens with the convention over
configuration approach, and it took some time and a bit of googling to get used to using the various helper methods,
and how to pass various options to the helper methods. It isnt immediately obvious in some cases what magic the
framework prodides, however after skimming the documentation this has become clearer.

HAML is interesting - I'm not a fan of templating languages that detract from writing actual HTML, however I do
understand the benefits in terms of the templates ending up less verbose, and limits interoperability with tools
geared towards HTML editing. Although the syntax is fairly obvious, I feel
there might be issues here when less technical people need to maintain these templates. I think approaches such as
Handlebars templating are nicer, which maintain HTML syntax.
